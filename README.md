# MakeMeAPlaylist
This is code for a webpage which takes four user inputs to generate a unique, personalized Spotify playlist. 

I used HTML, external CSS, and JavaScript. 

I created it for a school project with the intention of helping my classmates discover new music.

The four user inputs are “Artist You Like,” “Song You Like," “Genre You Like,” and “Genre You Want to Get Into.” 

After the user inputs all the values, they click the "MAKE ME A PLAYLIST" button, after which a unique token is generated. 
I use this token to produce the link to the playlist, which the user can then listen to and follow.
